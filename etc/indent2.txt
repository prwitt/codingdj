This second part describes the PCS relationship among them:


- <html> is the root element
- <html> has no parents
- <html> is the parent of <head> and <body>
- <head> is the first child of <html>
- <body> is the last child of <html>
- <head> has one child: <title>
    - <title> has one child (text): "Basic II"
- <body> has three children: <table>, <h1> and <ul>
    - <table> has two children: <thead> and <tbody>
        - <thead> has one child: <tr>
            - <tr> has four children: <th> times four
            - each <th> has one conrresponding child (text): "First Name", "Last Name", "Email", "Password"
        - <tbody> has four children: <tr> times four
            - each <tr> has a single child: <td>
            - each <td> has one corresponding child (text): "Brendan", "Stanton", "brendanrocks@gmail.com", "FakePassword123"
        - <thead> and <tbody> are siblings
